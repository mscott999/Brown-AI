//Reflection
Today was the first day of the program and it was very informative.
The most interesting fact I learned is that the concept and idea of artificial intelligence has existed even before computers did, dating back to ancient Greece.
I also learned that developing an AI capable of performing a simple task is manageable, however developing a general agent to fulfill a broad task is much more difficult.
Setting up the IDE we will be using for Python was easy, and I am excited to begin work on our future projects!
